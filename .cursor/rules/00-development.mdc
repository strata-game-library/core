# strata Development

## Package Overview

Procedural 3D graphics library for React Three Fiber.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install         # Install deps
pnpm run build       # Build with tsc
pnpm run test        # Run vitest tests
pnpm run format      # Format with Prettier
```

## Key Patterns

- Core algorithms are pure TypeScript (no React)
- Uniform interfaces need `[uniform: string]: THREE.IUniform`
- Use `/* glsl */` template literals for shaders
- Use Prettier for formatting
