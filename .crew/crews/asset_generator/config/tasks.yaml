# Asset Generator Tasks

design_asset:
  description: |
    Design a 3D asset based on the specification: {spec}
    
    Create a detailed prompt for text-to-3D generation that will produce
    a high-quality game asset. Consider:
    - Art style consistency
    - Topology for animation
    - Material/texture requirements
    - Scale and proportions
  expected_output: |
    A detailed asset design document including:
    - Generation prompt for Meshy API
    - Style guidelines
    - Technical requirements
  agent: asset_designer

direct_animation:
  description: |
    Direct the rigging and animation for the generated 3D model.
    
    Specify:
    - Skeleton structure needed
    - Animation clips to generate (idle, walk, run, attack, etc.)
    - Animation style and timing
  expected_output: |
    Animation direction document including:
    - Rigging requirements
    - Animation clip specifications
    - Timing and style notes
  agent: animation_director
  context:
    - design_asset

review_asset:
  description: |
    Review the generated asset and animations for quality.
    
    Check:
    - Visual quality and style consistency
    - Animation smoothness
    - Technical correctness (topology, materials)
    - Game-readiness
  expected_output: |
    QA review report with:
    - Quality assessment
    - Issues found (if any)
    - Approval status
    - Recommendations
  agent: qa_reviewer
  context:
    - design_asset
    - direct_animation
