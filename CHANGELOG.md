# Changelog v1.4.0

## ✨ Features

### **API Documentation & Examples**
- A new API documentation site is now available, featuring 26 comprehensive, JSDoc-linked examples. This showcase is designed to help you quickly understand Strata's capabilities and get started with your projects. (@Copilot)

### **User Interface Improvements**
- Enhanced the accessibility of the in-app notifications and inventory UI. These changes ensure a better and more inclusive experience for all users. (@google-labs-jules[bot])

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Math:** Fixed an issue in the `smoothstep` utility function where it would incorrectly return `NaN` (Not a Number) when provided with a zero value range. This ensures predictable and stable behavior in mathematical calculations. (@google-labs-jules[bot])

## ⚡ Performance

- **Core:** Optimized low-level noise functions by reducing memory allocations. This leads to less garbage collection pressure and smoother performance, especially in scenes with heavy procedural generation or particle effects. (@google-labs-jules[bot])

## 💥 Breaking Changes

- **Dependency:** Upgraded `@xstate/react` from v5 to v6. While this is an internal dependency, it may contain breaking changes if you were relying on Strata's internal state management logic in an unconventional way.

## 👻 Internal & Maintenance

This release includes numerous updates to improve the developer experience and project maintainability. These changes include:
- Upgrading various production and development dependencies (`maath`, `zod`, `@types/node`).
- Migrating and improving our GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows.
- Adding code coverage reporting via Coveralls.
- Syncing repository configuration files.

A special thank you to all contributors, including @dependabot[bot], @Jon Bogaty, and @google-labs-jules[bot], for their work on these foundational improvements.
