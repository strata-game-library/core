-   **React Integration**: Full suite of React Three Fiber components and custom hooks are now available, making it easier than ever to build interactive 3D scenes.
-   **Procedural Tooling**: Powerful GLSL shader system, math utilities, and geometry/procedural generation systems have been integrated.
-   **Developer Tools & Presets**: Extracted debug tools and a collection of preset configurations to accelerate development.
-   **Unified API**: A clean, unified export structure is now in place, simplifying imports and access to all library features.
