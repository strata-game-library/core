# Strata Game Framework Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the evolution of Strata from a rendering toolkit to a complete game framework.

## Phase 1: Architecture & Documentation (Week 1)

**Goal**: Establish architectural foundation through RFCs and documentation.

### Deliverables
- [x] Epic #50: Master tracking issue
- [ ] RFC #51: Game Orchestration Architecture
- [ ] RFC #52: Compositional Object System
- [ ] RFC #53: World Topology System
- [ ] RFC #54: Declarative Game Definition
- [ ] Architecture documentation
- [ ] Agent instructions update
- [ ] Initial PR for peer review

### Success Criteria
- All RFCs reviewed and approved
- Clear implementation path defined
- Agent documentation complete

## Phase 2: Game Orchestration Layer (Weeks 2-3)

**Goal**: Implement core game orchestration primitives.

### Deliverables

#### SceneManager
- [ ] Scene interface and lifecycle
- [ ] Scene registration and loading
- [ ] Scene stack (push/pop for overlays)
- [ ] Async scene loading with progress

#### ModeManager
- [ ] Mode interface and configuration
- [ ] Mode stack with push/pop/replace
- [ ] Mode-specific system activation
- [ ] Mode transition hooks

#### TriggerSystem
- [ ] Trigger component for ECS
- [ ] Proximity, collision, interaction triggers
- [ ] Trigger conditions and actions
- [ ] Cooldown and one-shot triggers

#### TransitionSystem
- [ ] Fade, crossfade, wipe effects
- [ ] Configurable duration and easing
- [ ] Async transition promises

### Success Criteria
- All orchestration primitives implemented
- Unit tests with 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests for mode switching
- Example: Multi-mode game demo

## Phase 6: Validation (Week 8)

**Goal**: Validate framework with Rivermarsh rebuild.

### Deliverables

#### Rivermarsh Port
- [ ] Port to declarative definition
- [ ] All creatures as creature definitions
- [ ] All biomes as regions
- [ ] Rivers as waterway connections
- [ ] Racing mode integration

#### Metrics
