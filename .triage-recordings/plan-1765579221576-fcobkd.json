            "thinking": "1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n\n    *   **Role:** Triage Assistant. This means my job isn't to *fix* the issue, but to *classify* it. I need to determine its type and priority. This requires understanding the issue's nature and its impact on the project and users.\n    *   **Input:** A structured issue report with a Title, Problem description, Source (PR, file, lines), Suggested Fix, and a Parent Epic.\n    *   **Key Information Points:**\n        *   **Problem:** \"Multiple empty catch blocks silently swallow errors, making debugging extremely difficult.\" This is the core issue. The impact is on *developer experience* and *maintainability*. It doesn't directly affect end-users *unless* a swallowed error leads to a bigger, more visible bug later.\n        *   **Platform:** Android (`StrataPlugin.java`). This is specific.\n        *   **Location:** Specific lines in a specific file. This is a well-defined, localized problem.\n        *   **Suggested Fix:** Add logging (`Log.w(...)`). This is a simple, low-risk fix.\n        *   **Source:** Found during a PR review by automated tools (Gemini, Claude). This reinforces its status as a code quality/maintainability issue.\n        *   **Parent Epic:** #37. I don't have details on #37, but the existence of a parent epic suggests this is part of a larger, coordinated effort, likely around code health, quality, or bug fixing.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Issue Type:**\n\n    *   What *kind* of issue is this?\n        *   **Bug?** Yes, but it's not a functional bug that breaks a feature for an end-user. It's a *developer experience* bug. It \"breaks\" the debugging process. A \"Bug\" label is appropriate, but maybe with a qualifier. \"Code Quality Bug\" or just \"Bug\" would work.\n        *   **Feature Request?** No. We're not adding new functionality. We're improving the existing (and broken) behavior.\n        *   **Improvement/Enhancement?** Absolutely. This is a perfect fit. It improves the codebase without changing user-facing features. It enhances maintainability and debuggability.\n        *   **Task/Chore?** This is also a strong candidate. A \"chore"
